# Comment Toxicity Detection

This machine learning project aims to detect toxic comments using advanced models. The project is hosted live [here](https://comment-toxicity.streamlit.app/).

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify comments as toxic or non-toxic. The web application is built using Streamlit for easy interaction with the model, making it accessible to users who want to test or evaluate the model's predictions.

## Features

- **Real-time toxicity detection:** Users can input comments and receive toxicity predictions instantly.
- **Interactive Interface:** The app provides an intuitive interface with a top bar displaying the model name and version, a left panel for selecting models, and a section for inputting comments and viewing predictions.
- **Multiple Model Support:** Easily switch between different models and versions for comparison.

## Live Application
